## :scroll: Description

Repository for the Jetpack Compose [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge) week 2 \- Countdown timer.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context

In  the project, I try to use Compose State, Animation, layout of Compose, things get interesting, but because there is not much free time, tshhere are the following tasks to be completed:

- [ ] Finish the time selection view animation, maybe it should show a list of time.
- [ ] Finish wave animation when end counter.
